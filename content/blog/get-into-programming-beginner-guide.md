# Introduction

Programming (also known as *coding* or *development*) can be a creative hobby, a lucrative career, or both.

The main skill required for a programmer is **problem solving**. "*I want to achieve X, what can I do to achieve X?*"

It's also important to be **adaptable, open to learning new things**. The field is ever-evolving, and there's always something new to learn.

Finally, if you don't intend to work on solo projects, **efficient communication** with teammates is crucial.

# Pick a Language

A programmer's job is to write *source code* in a **programming language**. This means text files containing specific formatting called *syntax*. Each programming language has a different *syntax*, and different use cases. For example, the Linux kernel is written in the programming language C, the website you're viewing in HTML[^1], and Minecraft in Java.
[^1]: Technically, it's written in Markdown and converted to HTML later.

If you already know what you want to work on, pick a language from the table below.

Use case|Language
-|-
Anything|Python
Websites|Javascript
Android Apps|Kotlin
iOS Apps|Swift
Programs for Windows|C#
Video Games|C++
Corporate work|Java

Keep in mind, that your first language will be the hardest one. **90% of the skills you gain will transfer to other languages.** The logic behind most programming languages is very similar, only the *syntax* changes a lot. Different languages might also be made to interact with different components - for example, Python has some great libraries for Data Science.

# Terminology

- **Git**: A *version control system*, allowing you to keep track of the progress you make in your source files and possibly roll back unwanted changes. I have a [cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/linux/git) for git.
- **Source code**: The text files the programmer writes.
- **Compilation/build**: The act of instructing the computer to turn source code into executables.
- **Executable/binary**: The program that the computer can run. Windows users might know these as `.exe` files.
- **Open-Source**: White someone else can run your program if you share an executable with them, making the source code publicly readable can act as proof that you're not sharing a virus. It also welcomes other developer to contribute and improve your code.
- **Libraries/includes**: Most programs are not written from scratch. They tend to include code written by others. For example, a video game might include a library for drawing graphics on screen.
- **Crash**: When a program runs into an error it cannot recover from and stops abruptly.

# Start Learning

I recommend picking a project that you want to work on rather than just exploring programming. Remember, "I want to achieve X, how do I achieve X" is the best driving force behind learning to code.

The best way to get started is to search for tutorial videos for your language of choice. YouTube has series for every major language - just search for something like *learn C++ for beginners*.

Stack Overflow is also very useful. It's a question-answer forum for programming problems. If you run into an error, searching for the error message on Stack Overflow will usually lead to someone who had to face the same issue - and answers by others who could help them.

Consider making an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/), or an alternative such as [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/) and open-sourcing your projects there.

Good luck ;)
