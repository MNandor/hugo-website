> Write my a power metal song in the style and with the patterns of the band Dragonforce. Make it about the version control system Git. Praise its usefulness and reference its features and subcommands.

Verse 1:\
With the power of Git, we'll conquer all\
Never lose our code, never let it fall\
Merging and branching, it's all so neat\
Push and pull, with Git, can't be beat

Chorus:\
Git, Git, the version control\
Git, Git, never lose a hold\
Git, Git, on the command line\
Git, Git, always on time

Verse 2:\
Commit and revert, it's all so grand\
Git log, Git diff, always in command\
Stash and cherry-pick, it's all so swell\
Git, Git, the version control, can't you tell

Chorus:\
Git, Git, the version control\
Git, Git, never lose a hold\
Git, Git, on the command line\
Git, Git, always on time

Bridge:\
GitHub and GitLab, it's all the same\
With Git, we'll never play the blame game\
Fork and clone, it's all so clear\
Git, Git, the version control, we hold dear

Chorus:\
Git, Git, the version control\
Git, Git, never lose a hold\
Git, Git, on the command line\
Git, Git, always on time

Outro:\
With the power of Git, our code will soar\
Never lose a file, never be a bore\
Git, Git, the version control\
Git, Git, forever in our souls.
