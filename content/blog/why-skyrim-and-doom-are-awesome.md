# Skyrim

Skyrim is a medieval fantasy RPG set in the world of Elder Scrolls. The planet is called Nirn, the continent Tamriel, and the country, well, Skyrim.

The player can freely explore the open world right after the tutorial area. She's encouraged to fight bandits, save people, learn magic, kill dragons, ride dragons, and influence the political landscape.

Skyrim is widely praised for how much it lets the player customize her Dragonborn, be it a Nord fighter wielding a greatsword, the oh-so-prevalent stealth archer Khajiit, or a mage who challenges herself by using anything but the Destruction school.

The best part about Skyrim is the fact that it has a hero. That's you. You are the hero. You have the freedom to go anywhere, the freedom to help or kill nearly anybody, and the only limitation is your own character's abilities. Your achievements will be recognized, your contributions felt, and your friendship rewarded.

Did you know, that the song that soundtrack that plays during dragon encounters is called "One They Fear"? That's referring to *you*, the Dragonborn. It's not the boss music of dragons for you to listen to. It's *your* boss music.

Contrast this with real life, where you seem to hit hard walls way more often than you'd like to, where a bed to sleep is not a nice thing to find but rather a need, where some people will dislike you just because.

The typical gamer will be more introverted than average. The typical introvert will be less confident than average. Isn't it good that these people can live in a world where they are the hero? Don't they deserve to feel like they can achieve anything they want, too?

I used the phrasing "contrast this with real life". Doesn't real life work the same way? Is there anything physically preventing you from going on an adventure?

Maybe I only feel like there isn't because I'm more confident. I did play Skyrim after all.

# Doom 2016

> They are rage.\
> Brutal, without mercy.\
> But you, you will be worse.\
> Rip and tear until it is done.

The intro quote does a surprisingly good job describing what Doom is. The enemy is vicious, dangerous. And *they* are the ones who need to run from *you*.

Doom 2016 technically has a story! And those who appreciate the lore might even dig into it. But the game doesn't try to push it too hard. It's made very clear, that the selling point is the mindless killing along with the power fantasy of pulling off various weapon-switch combo moves as the player dishes out death to a horde of demons.

Some games are designed to make the player feel like he's overcoming challenges. Doomguy though, he's just a butcher in a slaughterhouse.

Something something, violent games, violent tendencies? Nah. Being born causes violent tendencies. If anything, violent games are a great way to let out the steam without causing real damage.
