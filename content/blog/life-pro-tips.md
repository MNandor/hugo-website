## Food

- If you're not particularly good at cooking, or won't have much time to do so, get yourself a slow cooker.
- Put a small cup filled with water in the microwave when reheating pizza or pasta.
- Using an electric kettle will always be more efficient than a stove.
- Rice is cheap and filling. Peanuts have lots of protein.

## Financial

- Make a bank account as soon as you legally can. Be the sole owner of it.
- Living with your parents to save money is perfectly reasonable with no age limit.
- Pay yourself first - set money aside *before* thinking about how much you can spend.
- Do not ever pay a cent in credit card interest. If you couldn't pay it off immediately, you can't afford it.
- The more you think about trading stocks, the worse your results - buy, diversify, hold.

## Social

- Asking people for help typically makes them like you more, not less. Particularly teachers.
- Be respectful to waiters and friendly with cleaning staff.
- Smiles work.

## Psychological

- Do not worry about things you can't control.
- Ask yourself "Will this matter in a year's time?" when stressing over something.
