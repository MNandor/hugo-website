Arch Linux is a Linux {{< abbr `distribution`>}}distro{{< / abbr >}} that's *relatively* hard to install.
While guided installers do exist, part of an Arch user's pride comes from going through the process manually.
It's actually not difficult at all - running a list on commands in the right order with occasional decisionmaking woven in - but it is a great learning opportunity.

This guide is based on my personal notes.
Parts not relevant to me, such as a non-English keyboard layout it omitted because I never needed it.

# Get The Disk Image

Unless you're installing Arch in a {{< abbr `Virtual Machine`>}}VM{{< / abbr >}}, you're going to need a USB flash drive.
This is fairly normal for all Linux distros.
Keep in mind that all data on the flash drive will be wiped.
All data on the computer you're installing on will likely also be wiped - so **take backups**.
