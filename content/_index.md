# Welcome


{{% floatleft reallifepfp %}}


## Hi, I'm NÃ¡ndor.

As an Android developer, I am passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly mobile apps that deliver a great experience for users. With the rapid growth and evolution of the Android platform, there are always new and exciting opportunities to explore, and I am constantly learning and growing as a developer to stay at the forefront of the industry.

Whether I am working on a new app from scratch, or optimizing and improving an existing app, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality apps that are reliable, performant, and user-friendly.

I am also an advocate of open-source software, and believe in the power of collaboration and community to drive innovation and progress in the tech industry. In my work as an Android developer, I strive to create apps that are useful, user-friendly, and adhere to the principles of open-source software.

I also happily use custom ROMs. Currently on LineageOS, but I'm planning to explore GrapheneOS and /e/OS soon.

# More About Me

## Linux

I'm a full-time Linux user (Arch btw) and I also maintain my home server using Fedora. I started with Ubuntu in 2019 and settled on Arch soon after.
I like to tinker with my system when I have the time, and many of my scripts and config files can be found on my GitHub.

My desktop consists of Qtile as my Window Manager, Vim as my text editor, Firefox as my browser, and Bash as my shell.

## Python

Though I work in Android, I enjoy using Python for all kinds of desktop-based scripting tasks. The vast array of libraries and convenience of coding Python provides is just invaluable.

Many of my projects, including my BSc thesis were written in Python.

## Other

I know just enough HTML/CSS to have made this website. I have some experience with Javascript - my Anki card templates were written with it.

I use Markdown for note-taking, or LaTeX for serious publications.

I think that Git is still underappreciated despite its popularity. There is some real magic there, once you learn more than the two or three most common commands.

## Hobbies

I enjoy learning languages! I speak English, Hungarian, some Romanian, some German, and an ever-so-tiny amount of Japanese. I have a few others in mind for the future, too.

I recently got back into playing Chess.

Hiking. I love hiking.
