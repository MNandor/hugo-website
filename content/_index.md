# Welcome

![text](/img/reallifepfp.png)

## About Me

My name is NÃ¡ndor.

I like free and open source software.

## Android

I currently work as an Android developer in Java and Kotlin.

I've been working in Agile teams and got to work on applications connecting to IoT devices.

## Linux

I like Linux because it blurs the line between the user and the developer. Are you a developer if you run a command you found online? Obviously not. Are you a developer if you pipe a couple commands into each other? Still probably not... What if you write your own bash functions or share your config files with others?

I use Arch btw.

## Python

Python is my favorite programming language. I know that C is faster, but a lot of the time, development time is more valuable than runtime.

Tabs over spaces. Sue me.

## Other

I know just enough HTML/CSS to have made this website. I also know Javascript, but I don't feel the need to execute any code on this page.

I speak English, Hungarian, some Romanian, some German, and an ever-so-tiny amount of Japanese.
